# Debug Output Cleanup Task - Issue #66

**Problem Statement**: The Simulacrum module contains excessive debug outputs throughout the codebase that need to be cleaned up to provide a professional user experience. Only critical state changes and error logging should be preserved.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All unnecessary console.log, console.debug, and console.info statements are removed from scripts/ directory
- Critical state changes and error logging are preserved
- Module logs are clean and professional
- No functionality is broken during cleanup
- All changes are validated through testing

**MVP Scope**: Remove excessive debug output while preserving only essential logging for errors and critical state changes.

## Phase 1: Investigation and Analysis

### project-investigator Tasks:
1. **Scan All JavaScript Files**: Search for all console.log, console.debug, console.info, console.warn, and console.error statements across the entire scripts/ directory
2. **Categorize Debug Statements**: Create a comprehensive inventory categorizing each logging statement as:
   - REMOVE: Development/debugging info no longer needed
   - KEEP: Critical state changes, errors, or important user information
   - REVIEW: Borderline cases requiring evaluation
3. **Identify Debug Patterns**: Look for common debug patterns and verbose logging areas:
   - Function entry/exit logging
   - Variable state dumps
   - Development timing/performance logs
   - Excessive API call logging
   - Temporary debugging statements
4. **Risk Assessment**: Identify any logging that might be tied to error handling or user feedback mechanisms
5. **File Priority Analysis**: Determine which files have the most excessive debug output requiring cleanup

### Research Questions:
- Which files contain the highest density of debug statements?
- Are there any console statements that serve as user notifications or error feedback?
- What logging patterns are used for legitimate error handling vs development debugging?
- Are there any console statements in critical code paths that might indicate important state changes?

### Investigation Scope:
- Focus ONLY on scripts/ directory (excluding tests/ and other directories)
- Include fimlib/ submodule files within scripts/
- Search patterns: console.log, console.debug, console.info, console.warn, console.error
- Document findings with file locations and categorization recommendations

## Phase 2: Implementation and Cleanup

### implementation-tester Tasks:
1. **Remove Unnecessary Debug Statements**: Systematically remove all console statements categorized as "REMOVE" from Phase 1
2. **Preserve Critical Logging**: Ensure all error handling and critical state change logging remains intact
3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Review borderline cases and make conservative decisions (when in doubt, keep the logging)
4. **Maintain Code Readability**: Ensure removal doesn't impact code structure or readability
5. **Batch Processing**: Process files in logical groups to maintain consistency

### Implementation Requirements:
- Remove ONLY console.log, console.debug, and console.info statements identified as unnecessary
- PRESERVE all console.error and console.warn statements (these are typically critical)
- PRESERVE any console statements that provide user feedback or error information
- DO NOT modify any error handling logic - only remove debug output statements
- Maintain all existing functionality and code structure
- Apply changes systematically file by file

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Functionality Validation**: Ensure all core module functionality works after cleanup
2. **Error Handling Verification**: Confirm error handling and user feedback mechanisms still work
3. **Critical State Logging**: Verify important state changes are still properly logged
4. **UI/UX Testing**: Ensure no user-facing functionality is broken
5. **Integration Testing**: Test with FoundryVTT to ensure module loads and operates correctly

### Validation Criteria:
- Module initializes without errors
- All tools and features function as expected
- Critical errors are still properly logged
- No user-facing functionality is broken
- Console output is significantly reduced and professional

## Phase 3: Documentation and Completion

### project-documentation-writer Tasks:
1. **Document Changes Made**: Create summary of files modified and types of debug statements removed
2. **Update Issue Status**: Document completion status and any decisions made during cleanup
3. **Provide Cleanup Statistics**: Report on number of debug statements removed vs preserved
4. **Note Any Preserved Logging**: Document why specific console statements were kept for future reference

### Documentation Requirements:
- Summary of files modified with before/after debug statement counts
- Categorization of what was removed vs what was preserved
- Any edge cases or decisions that required evaluation
- Recommendations for future debug statement management

## Dependencies and Prerequisites:
- Access to all JavaScript files in scripts/ directory
- Understanding of FoundryVTT module architecture and error handling patterns
- Ability to test module functionality after changes
- ESLint configuration should remain satisfied after cleanup

## Success Metrics:
1. **Quantitative**: Significant reduction in console output during normal operation
2. **Qualitative**: Professional, clean console output focused on errors and critical information
3. **Functional**: All module features work correctly after cleanup
4. **Maintainable**: Code remains readable and maintainable post-cleanup

## Risk Mitigation:
- Make conservative decisions - when in doubt, preserve the logging statement
- Focus on obviously unnecessary debug output (development/testing artifacts)
- Test thoroughly after each batch of changes
- Maintain git history for easy rollback if needed

## Completion Criteria:
- All files in scripts/ directory have been reviewed and cleaned
- Functionality testing confirms no regressions
- Console output during normal operation is professional and minimal
- Only error logging and critical state changes remain
- Issue #66 can be marked as resolved

## Notes:
- This is strictly a cleanup task - no new features or enhancements should be added
- Focus on the MVP: remove excessive debug output while preserving essential logging
- Prioritize user experience and professional presentation over comprehensive logging
- Be systematic and thorough to ensure no excessive debug output remains
