## Configuration Architecture Fix

### ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED**

**Problem**: The configuration files contained architectural flaws that violated design principles:

1. **Hardcoded FoundryVTT Versions**: Both `test.config.json` and `test.config.template.json` contained hardcoded version arrays with specific zip file names (`FoundryVTT-12.343.zip`, `FoundryVTT-Node-13.347.zip`) that contradicted the dynamic version discovery system.

2. **Overcomplicated System Configuration**: Systems were configured as complex objects with names, download URLs, and enabled flags instead of simple ID arrays.

3. **Configuration Inconsistency**: Template and actual config had different ordering and structures.

**Solution**: Complete configuration architecture redesign:

```json
// BEFORE (Problematic):
{
  "versions": [
    {
      "version": "v12",
      "zipFile": "FoundryVTT-12.343.zip",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ],
  "systems": [
    {
      "id": "dnd5e",
      "name": "D&D 5th Edition", 
      "downloadUrl": "https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/archive/master.zip",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}

// AFTER (Clean Architecture):
{
  "systems": ["dnd5e", "pf2e"]
  // versions array removed - handled by dynamic discovery
}
```

**Result**: 
- âœ… **Dynamic Version Discovery**: `test-config.js` automatically discovers FoundryVTT versions from `binary_versions` directory
- âœ… **Simplified Systems**: Clean array format that's easily extensible
- âœ… **Consistent Structure**: Template and actual config are now identical
- âœ… **Maintainable Configuration**: No hardcoded version numbers to maintain

### FoundryVTT State Analysis

```
FoundryVTT Bootstrap Analysis:
  Document ready: complete
  Page location: http://localhost:30000/license
  Has license input: true
  Has setup screen: false
  Has game interface: false
  Has error message: false
  Total inputs: 1
  Total buttons: 1
  FoundryVTT state validation: VALID
```

### Configuration Validation

```
=== CONFIGURATION VALIDATION ===
âœ… Dynamic Versions: [
  { version: 'v12', zipFile: 'FoundryVTT-12.343.zip', enabled: true },
  { version: 'v13', zipFile: 'FoundryVTT-Node-13.347.zip', enabled: true }
]
âœ… Simplified Systems: [ 'dnd5e', 'pf2e' ]
âœ… Docker Config: { start: 30000, end: 30010 }
âœ… License Key: ${FOUNDRY_LICENSE_KEY}
=== CONFIGURATION IS PROPERLY STRUCTURED ===
```

**Key Finding**: FoundryVTT successfully loads to the license screen, and configuration dynamically discovers versions while maintaining clean, maintainable structure.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Character Encoding Issues âœ… FIXED
- **Problem**: Template literal syntax errors with emoji characters
- **Solution**: Replaced problematic Unicode characters with plain text
- **Files affected**: `tests/integration/docker-basic.test.js` â†’ `docker-basic-fixed.test.js`

### 2. Page Loading Detection âœ… FIXED  
- **Problem**: Puppeteer connecting to `about:blank` instead of FoundryVTT
- **Solution**: Added explicit wait for FoundryVTT page title and proper navigation handling
- **Result**: Successfully connects to `http://localhost:30000/license`

### 3. License Screen Detection âœ… VALIDATED
- **Previous assumption**: License screens would block testing
- **Reality**: License screens are properly detected and can be automated
- **Result**: License input field and submit button detected correctly

### 4. Configuration Architecture Issues âœ… FIXED  
- **Problem**: Hardcoded FoundryVTT versions in config files contradicting dynamic discovery system
- **Problem**: Overcomplicated system configuration with full objects instead of simple ID arrays
- **Problem**: Inconsistent structure between test.config.json and test.config.template.json
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed hardcoded `versions` array entirely (dynamic discovery handles this)
  - Simplified `systems` to clean array: `["dnd5e", "pf2e"]`
  - Aligned template and actual config structures
  - Maintained all essential configuration (docker, puppeteer, bootstrap, foundryLicenseKey)
- **Result**: Clean, maintainable configuration architecture aligned with design principles
