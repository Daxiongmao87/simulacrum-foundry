# Product Vision

Simulacrum is an agentic assistant built exclusively for FoundryVTT Game Masters. It supercharges campaign management by understanding the full breadth of a world’s documents—actors, items, journal entries, and every other in-world artifact—and answering questions with that context at hand. When the GM asks for revisions, Simulacrum researches related material, writes or edits any document they can access, and keeps the narrative voice consistent with the campaign.

The module mirrors the strengths of modern coding copilots while staying rooted in Foundry. It is system-agnostic: Simulacrum inspects the active world to discover available document types and their schemas, then adapts its toolset automatically. That adaptability ensures it remains useful across rule systems, homebrew content, and evolving compendia.

Simulacrum is API-flexible. It speaks to OpenAI-compatible and Gemini-compatible endpoints, and it can fall back to a legacy tool-call loop whenever a provider lacks native tool support. All integrations share the same agentic core so responses stay consistent regardless of the AI backend.

Every feature is measured against one promise: help the GM craft richer sessions with less manual work. Simulacrum should feel like a trusted co-GM—available at the table, aware of the campaign, and ready to accelerate prep, improvisation, and ongoing worldbuilding.
