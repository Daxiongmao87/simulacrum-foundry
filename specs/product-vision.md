# Specification Document

## Title
[x] Feature/Module Name: Product Vision Documentation

## Overview
[x] Brief description of purpose and scope:  
> Capture the Simulacrum product vision in-repo so every contributor aligns to the FoundryVTT-focused goal statement supplied by the owner.

## Requirements
- [x] Functional Requirements:  
  - [x] Req 1: Publish a concise, accessible product vision statement using owner-provided wording.  
  - [x] Req 2: Reference the vision from contributor guidance to keep it top of mind.

- [ ] Non-Functional Requirements (performance, scalability, etc.):  
  - [x] Req 1: Keep wording clear, authoritative, and future-proof; avoid jargon.  
  - [ ] Req 2: _________________________________________________  

## Inputs
- [x] Define expected inputs:  
  - Field: Owner-supplied goal narrative  
  - Type: Text  
  - Constraints: Preserve intent while polishing phrasing; no scope drift.

## Outputs
- [x] Define expected outputs:  
  - Field: Markdown document `VISION.md` (or similar)  
  - Type: Plain-text Markdown  
  - Rules: Title includes “Product Vision”; 150–250 words aimed at contributors.

## Behaviors / Flows
- [x] Primary flow:  
  1. Author product vision document with refined wording.  
  2. Link the document from `AGENTS.md` so contributors can locate it quickly.  
  3. Commit updates (when approved) to ensure everyone can reference the vision.

- [x] Edge cases:  
  - [x] Case 1: Future expansion allows additional sections without rewriting core statement.  
  - [x] Case 2: Contributors lacking context still understand scope by only reading vision.

## Examples (Acceptance Cases)
- [x] Example 1:  
  Input: Developer opens `VISION.md` → Output: Sees Simulacrum mission, audience, differentiators, API support modes.  
- [x] Example 2:  
  Input: Contributor reads `AGENTS.md` → Output: Finds link to `VISION.md` within Systems Overview or intro.  
- [x] Example 3 (Edge Case):  
  Input: Future doc adds roadmap section → Output: Core vision remains intact at top.

## Test Cases (for TDD seed)
- [x] Requirement → Test Case(s):  
  - Req 1 → Manual review ensures owner intent preserved, wording polished.  
  - Req 2 → `AGENTS.md` contains Markdown link to `VISION.md`.

## Planning Addendum (for OOD / Implementation Strategy)
- [x] Components / Modules:  
  - `VISION.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- [x] Classes & Interfaces:  
  - N/A (documentation-only)
- [x] Reuse / DRY considerations:  
  - Align language with architecture docs to avoid conflicting goals.
- [x] MVP task breakdown:  
  1. Draft `VISION.md` using refined goal text.  
  2. Update `AGENTS.md` to reference the vision.  
  3. Verify link works and wording stays concise.

### Status
