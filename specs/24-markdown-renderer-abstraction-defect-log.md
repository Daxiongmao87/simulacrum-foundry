| DL-240 | scripts/ui/simulacrum-sidebar-tab.js | 130-220 | Requirement | Medium | AI responses include markdown syntax but are stored as plain text, leaving formatting unrendered in Foundry's HTML-only chat log. | Introduce a markdown renderer utility leveraging Foundry's Showdown config and route AI output through it prior to enrichment. | Assistant | Closed | Markdown renderer converts AI output before `TextEditor.enrichHTML`, validated via unit and integration tests. |
