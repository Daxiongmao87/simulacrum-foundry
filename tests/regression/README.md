# Regression Tests

This directory contains regression tests designed to prevent re-introduction of bugs that have been previously fixed. These tests are typically Puppeteer-driven and focus on specific scenarios where a bug was identified.

When a bug is fixed, a new regression test should be added here to ensure the bug does not reappear in future development.
